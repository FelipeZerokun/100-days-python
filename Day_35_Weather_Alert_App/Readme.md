## Project 35: Weather Alert APP

This is a small project that you could find very useful.

Using an API from [OpenWeatherMaps.org](https://openweathermap.org/) and an API from [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) I made an app that will check the climate for the next 12 hours of certain location. The app will send a SMS to the user cellphone if it will rain in the next 12 hours.
