# 100 days of coding - Python
# Day 2: Tip Calculator
# By Felipe Rojas
# Learning how to use numeric variables with the input function.
# Changing variables data types with the int() and float() functions.

# If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
# Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
# Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
# Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
