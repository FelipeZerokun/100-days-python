## Project 2: Tip calculator

This project calculates how much each person should pay for a bill, taking into account certain tip percentage.
The program asks the user for the total bill, a tip percentage (10, 12 or 15) and how many people are going to pay.
Because the function "input" returns a string variable, I had to convert each user input:
* Total bill should be a float.
* tip percentage should be a float.
* Number of people to that will pay should be an integer.
