## Project 5: Random Password Generator.

This is a really useful project where the users can generate random passwords with the number of letters, numbers and symbols of their choice.
There were two difficulties on this project in the course. Easy, where the position of the characters would not be randomized (first will be letters, then numbers and then symbols) abd hard where everything in the password would be randomized.

First of all, I created three lists, containing all the letters, all the numbers and all the symbols. From this list is where the program will randomly pick characters for the password.

For both easy and hard cases, what I first did was to ask the user how many letters, numbers and symbols would be in the password. With the FOR statement, I choose random characters from each list according to the number entered by the user. Concatenating each character in one variable.
