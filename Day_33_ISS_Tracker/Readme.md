## Project 33: ISS Tracker

This project will track the ISS [International Space Station](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.html) via their API.

An API [Application Programming Interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API) is an interface that allows two applications to communicate with each other. This means that any application could receive or send data through this connection.

There are several web pages or companies that offer connectivity to their APIs, free or paid, and they send you different kind of data. In this case, I will be requesting data to the ISS asking for their coordinates. 

To do this, the requests library is needed. Also, the URL from the website we want to get the data is necessary. Here is the [API](http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json) for the ISS position.
