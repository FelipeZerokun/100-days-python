## Project 23: Turtle crossing Game

The second Capstone project of the course, and another classic game!

Using everything I have learnt from class inheritance and OOP programming, I will be recreating the famous game Frogger!

And just like the previous games, I started by creating classes for the different elements I need for the game.
For this project, I will need three elements: The turtle crossing the road, the cars and the scoreboard.

For the turtle class, it is almost the same as the paddle class. Inhering methods from the Turtle module, I just created three new methods. move_up and move_down methods to move the turtle up and down, and the reset_pos method to reset the turtle to its initial position.
