# 100 Days of Python
## Project 1ï¼”: Higher-Lower Game.

Another project game. Here, the user must guess which celebrity has more followers on Instagram. The celebrities data in on a different file called data.py. The data may be a bit outdated from actual numbers, but works the same. This project shows how really useful can dictionaries be as a data structure. If you check the data.py file, you will see that all the dictionaries have the same "keys" names, but different values. This is really useful when you need to call different dictionaries from a list using the same keyword.
