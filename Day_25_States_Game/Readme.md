## Project 25: States game

Here I learnt how to use CSV files!
CSV (Comma-separated value) is a delimited text file that separates values using commas. This is a pretty common way to store and share tabular data, o a single relationship database.

I made a small project before the main one, and I uploaded because it was really interesting for me. So, I will explain the small project first, before the States game project.

The Great Squirrel Census project was a really interesting project from [The squirrel Census](https://www.thesquirrelcensus.com/), where numerous volunteers went to the Central Park to count up all the squirrels in the park.
