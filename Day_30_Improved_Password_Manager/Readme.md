## Project 30: Improved password manager

In the previous project I made a simple password generator that would save different passwords from different websites in a TXT file. However, but to see the passwords the user should open the file and look for it manually. In this improved password manager, the user can search for an specific website and the program will return the password.

In the try_catch_exceptions I just practice a bit with the most common errors, and using Try to get this errors and printing messages or running a different code. I find this pretty useful, specially when I need the user to enter specific inputs. Since I can't really control what the user inputs in my program, I can use code to prevent errors from this inputs and instead give messages or do something else.

In the other folder is the project. Almost all the project is the same as the original password manager, but I made a new function called search, which will get the data in the website textbox and seach our file. Here I will use Try and search for the keyword, but if it is not in the file, I will prompt a message telling the user that no data was found.

Now, the other different thing here is that I am using a json file. Json ([JavaScript Object Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)) is another format that can be used to manipulate and send data. Json is a pretty common data format. To open a json file in the program I needed to import the Json library. In the next project I will be using Json format data and practice a bit more with it.
