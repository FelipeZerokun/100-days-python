# 100 Days of Python
## Project 9: Secret Auction

This project will let different users enter a value, and in the end the user that entered the biggest value wins.
I used dictonaries for the users and their bids. It is a great way to keep two different values together. For example, the user_01 bid $50, I want these two values to always be correlated. I defined a function that asks for the name and bids from different users, gets them in a dictionary and then adds the dictionary to a list where all the users with their own bids will be kept.
The program will keep asking for new names and bids until a user confirms no new entries. After this, using a loop I checked every bid in the list, and return the name of the user with the higher big.
