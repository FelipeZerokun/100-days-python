# 100 Days of Python
## Project 37: Habit Tracking APP

Here I made a small habit tracker that shows how many days in a row the user has done some activity, and how much activity per day. Here is an example of how:
![Pixela example](./pixela_image.png "Habit Tracking example")
For this I will be using the [Pixela](https://pixe.la/) website. Pixela has a Github you can check and support here: [Pixela's Github](https://github.com/a-know/Pixela)

Here I used other methods from HTTP requests. With these methods I can send, update and delete data from another program or website.

Following the "How do I use Pixela?" section, the first step is to create a username. Here you just need a username and a token which you can make yourself. The other parameters are agreeTermsOfService and notMinor, both must be Yes.

The second step is to create a graph definition.
