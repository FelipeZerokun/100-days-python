## Proyecto 27: TKinter Unit Converter

TKinter is a python library for Graphical User Interface, or [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). A Graphical user interface are graphical tools that the users can use to enter different kind of inputs. TKinter is a really good toolkit, and what most users are a accustomed to, since these tools are used by almost all programs and OS.
Here are some example of TKinter tools:
* Text box
* Button
* Spinbox
* Scale
* Check button
* Radio button

I used all these tools in the tkbasics.py file, inside of the folder. These tools are really good for the user to interact directly with our program, and we can get different kind of inputs.
There is another file in this folder called playground.py where I used positional arguments. So far, in the functions and methods I created I only used arguments. For example, in the calculator project, all the functions asked the user for two numerical arguments. But, what If the user wanted to add more than two numbers? In that case we would have to use the add function several times. With positional arguments, the user can enter different amount of arguments when using a function or method. 

An argument with one astetrik (*arg), will store all the arguments as list, while a argument with two asterisks (**kwargs) will take arguments as dictionarties.
