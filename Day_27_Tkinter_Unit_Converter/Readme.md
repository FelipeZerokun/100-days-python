## Proyecto 27: TKinter Unit Converter

TKinter is a python library for Graphical User Interface, or [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface). A Graphical user interface are graphical tools that the users can use to enter different kind of inputs. TKinter is a really good toolkit, and what most users are a accustomed to, since these tools are used by almost all programs and OS.
Here are some example of TKinter tools:
* Text box
* Button
* Spinbox
* Scale
* Check button
* Radio button

I used all these tools in the tkbasics.py file. These tools are really good for the user to interact directly with our program, and we can get different kind of inputs.
