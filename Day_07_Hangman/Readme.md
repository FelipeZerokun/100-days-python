## Project 7: Hangman game

Another classic game in Python!
The Hangman is a popular game where the user tries to guess the hidden word without too many mistakes.
This is the first project where I divide it into multiple files. In this case, I used three files:
* main.py is where the code for the game is written.
* art.py where I stored some ASCII art.
* hangman.py where I stored a list of words that will be used for the game.
